      description: 'The laptop is over all very good. But few points to note:The sound is not that much good. It will be difficult to listen properly in a conf call/meeting. Specially for our little kids who are doing online classes.We had to use another speaker or head set.The touch pad is little buggy. while moving the mouse pointer it sometime drags objects under it. This might create problem when you are in hurry.Camera was OK. But you have to remember to attach the camera.The battery back up is excellent. But if you are playing game then it drains 50% of battery in 30 minutes. It may be normal in comparison with other laptop but Im not too sure.Other than these points still did not find any problem in last 14 days.' ,

But even today after a complete restart, same experience...my old hp is definitely 10 times faster than this new Dell laptop' ,
